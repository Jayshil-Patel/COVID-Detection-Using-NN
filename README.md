 # Classification of COVID patients using Neural Networks

>COVID-19 or Coronavirus is it not from which we are unaware, As per resources we know COVID-19’s origin set foot in a lab of Wuhan in China. COVID-19 has infected above 187,000,000 cases and took more than 400,000 lives [as of 13 July 2021]. COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially and testing kits, doctors, and resources are limited. To test covid patients with slightest symptoms is necessary, if not the person could be a super spreader and inturn can claim many lives.  The reported percentage of accuracy of RT-PCR  is around 96%, hence out of 100 people, around 4 people may be positive and can be claimed negative and vice versa, this is a serious issue and can result in many unforeseen circumstances. In this internship, we have made a pre-trained neural network that will take a chest X-Ray and categorizes the X-Ray into binary classification, giving us information about the COVID positive nature of the X-Ray.

>The model is trained using 250+ images of globally available COVID-19 patient’s X-rays and normal images. The model can categorize the X-Ray (i.e find the patient is positive or negative) with an accuracy of 96.88% which is as close as to the RTPCR test. Time taken to get output is just in a fraction of seconds whereas the RT-PCR test can deliver a reliable diagnosis in three hours and the cost of CNN-based covid detection can be remarkably less. This is by no means a production-ready solution, it just provides basic information about the positives and negatives classification.

## Literature review

>This report is based on the project by Hindwai’s International journal of biomedical engineering. It uses deep learning to train the model for COVID-19 detection, the images used here were rooted in Github’s profile. This is an open-source library used for research purposes for the same COVID detection. This repository contains training and validation folders for both normal and COVID positive patient’s chest X-Ray. The Patient’s X-Ray, which was supposed to be tested, was classified into these two binaries, i.e. normal and positive.

>The model consists of a [.py](https://github.com/Jayshil-Patel/COVID-Detection-Using-NN/blob/master/final_code.py) file that contains the model and trained epochs. The model here is trained with the same [dataset](https://github.com/Jayshil-Patel/COVID-Detection-Using-NN/tree/master/CovidDataset) mentioned earlier. For writing, this.py file prerequisites are python, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. Due to shortage of time, and vast scope of these subjects all of them could not be fulfilled so all knowledge we have comprises in this project, and topics learned are used in this project.
